## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - Google Font

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced creating a responsive design using Flexbox. I learned how to effectively center elements both vertically and horizontally on the page. Additionally, I gained experience in using CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent color management throughout the stylesheet.

Here's an example of how I used Flexbox to center the QR code component:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

I also learned how to use CSS custom properties for colors:

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Advanced Flexbox layouts
- Implementing accessibility features
- Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts

### Useful resources
